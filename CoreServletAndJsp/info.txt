Each servlet has a its own html page that work with it
LINE 57 on submitResume.html: yet to create the see our policy page and link it up

	having issue with the shopping cart which consist of the following
catalogue.java
itemorder.java
item.java
shoppingcat.java
orderpage.java
kidbookspage
techbookpage
catalogpage

i am suspecting that the issue is with d servlet naming in the catalogpage

************************
page 310 aint running well due to outdated java, bt d code is right. try update java and re-rn shadowtextapplet.jsp

***************************
for any of the shareCounts1,2 or 3, add ?itemID=a1233&numItems=11&discountCode=0.95

*********************

for the taglib, i have to create different example by adding a number to the csajsp-tablib, the no r respectively 4 each java class in coreservlet.tags folder
